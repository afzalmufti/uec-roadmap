Choices / Richard Moore

- Dentists, not really a priority for them, they take a pretty up to date feed from the BDA https://www.bda.org which is updated monthly for NHS work + payments

- GPs is their next priority for them with a discovery just starting with Rachael Gibson

- Choices edit UI is a CMS view of the public-facing page layout. It has the same sub-screens as tabs and all of the same funtionality like maps and directions are on view.

- Much of it uses web wysiswyg interface circa 2003. While this looks easy to use, the data to check and edit is unstructured, and is easy to skip through. Profile updater on the other hand is a linear process, which does focus the user on completing the update as a task.

- Opening hours are entered using a grid of boxes for days x open/close pairs. There is a limit of three pairs of open/close times per day 

- Additional days, like bank holidays, can be set separately. They are not named, just have a dd/mm/yyyy date input.

- At the service level, there are checkboxes for the services and facilities on offer to be selected from. There are not individual opening or availability times for each of the services recorded here.

- There are lots of additional mostly free-text fields for other details, and news feeds. The activity on these varies widely between pharmacies, most aren't used.

- Maps are included, embedded from Bing, with directions available. This is a paid feature, to be replaced with Google maps (free) I understand.

Service finder // first thoughts

- Initial search is fairly simple, complicated by a need to know what is in the dropdown
	- does is meet expectations of contents?
	- are there synonyms? Can we add some?
	- any user need to use abreviations? (there is room)
	- automatic location guessing is problematic (doesn't tell where it has guessed)
	- location entered by user could be saved (even the last one)
	- GP finder seems a bit weak (could predict a few, england only)
	- the gender selector seems a bit strange too ... outcome?

- Graphic design could be bolder, simpler, clearer
- Layout kind of does mobile first, but desktop badly
- Would really really really like to get rid of the drop downs
- Would really like to try a one-thing-per-page flow
- Would like to try a map-first results
- Would like to add capacity data

... seems simple enough - is there some subtle complexity I'm missing?

Choices / Richard Moore

- Dentists, not really a priority for them, they take a pretty up to date feed from the BDA(?) which is updated monthly for NHS work + payments

- GPs is the next priority for them with a discovery just starting with Rachael Gibson

- Choices edit UI is a CMS view of the read-only page layout. Much of it uses web wysiswyg interface circa 2003 ... not flow/task based (and as such users can make incomplete updates)

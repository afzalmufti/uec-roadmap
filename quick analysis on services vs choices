** Analysis **
Services appear to be a mix of:
- Most commonly one or two ODS/DoS registered services - regular pharmacy service + NUMSAS emergency medication service
- additional ODS/DoS registered services, possibly with independent availability days/times
- Choices services selected from the menu, without independent availability data
- Additional free-text added services on the Choices page

Problems:
- The free text added services may or may not conform to any specific searches
- Both the free text services and the selected services have no additional data on availability and hours
- very few of these services are registered on DoS and therefore found on Service Finder

Objectives:
- Add some structure to the ODS/DoS registered services so services offered by pharmacies can be related to them and found in a single search
- Add the additional services offered by pharmacies so they can be found on both Choices and DoS
- Add granular availablity of days/hours for all services so they can be used
- Clean up free-text areas on Choices so services listed can be found as searchable services 


What are the Design issues?
Showing lots of services
Navigating lots of services x pharmacies
Showing lots of time data for pharmacies x services
Navigating to the required availability of a service x pharmacy, and next best alternative
Editing and reviewing lots of services, and their availability
